  * Do you find knowledge management software on the computer a bit intimidating? Do you trust physical storage more than the digital type? Do you just love arts and crafts and need a knowledge management system that appeals to that part of you? Maybe knowledge sticks better when you can see it spatially laid out? Whatever the reason you prefer pen and paper to computer-based note-taking systems - zettelkasten has you covered! This is how knowledge management has been done for years and it could work for you, too!
  * I do not personally have a physical zettelkasten. I host mine in the software Obsidian, you can learn more about it here: https://youtu.be/L9SLlxaEEXY
  * @scottscheper does have a physical zettelkasten and makes videos about it here on YouTube, so you could check those out, like this one I featured in the video: https://youtu.be/3oqxWdtvqlk
  * And thank you to @RileyEffective for the video of the slip box!
